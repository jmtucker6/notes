# 4 Variable Karnaugh Map
![k-map4](http://sub.allaboutcircuits.com/images/14116.png)

Groups of 4 in a square lock down 2 variables (only 2 other variables in the expression)
  - groups can overlap
  
Gropu of 8 reduces to one input variable

# Technical Terms
Literal: the number of variables appeared in a product term

Implicant: single square
  - groups can be combined to create less literals
 
Prime Implicant: implicant that cannot be combined into a larger implicant

Essential prime implicant: prime implicant includes at least one minterm (where f=1) that cannot be covered by other prime implicants
