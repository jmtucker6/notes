# Requirements Elicitation Activities
- Actors identification
  - type of users to support
- Scenarios identification
  - concrete example per functionality
- Use cases identification
  - generalize scenarios to completely represent the system
  - abstraction from scenarios describing all possible cases
  - this defines the scope of the system
- USe case refinement
- Use Case relationship identification
- Non-functional requirements identification

# Use Cases
## Elements
  - System
    - scope of the system to develop
  - Actor
    - has a goal in using the system
    
Use cases are initiated by actors and represents the complete flow of events through the system

## Actor
A member of the world outside the software product
  - frequently a user
  - need not be a human being
  
A potetnial problem is overlapping actors

## Essentials
- Acots
- Generalization/Inheritance
- <<includes>> and <<extends>>
- Association is not data flow
- Boundary Box
- Use case is an *elipse*
- Use Case Label is a *verb*
- Every Use Case has a scenario
  - labeled exactly as the Use Case
