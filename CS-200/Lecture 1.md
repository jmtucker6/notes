[SWEBOK](http://www.computer.org/web/swebok)

## Tools
- Class Diagram
- VPP
- UML (Unified Modeling Language)
  - works like a programming language (has a syntax)
  
## Software Engineering

Original Definition: the establishment and use of sound engineering principles in order to obtain economically software that is reliable and works efficiently on real machines.
  - Fritz Bauer at a conference held to discuss the software crisis in the late 1960s
  - The situation is very similar currently

Schach "production of quality software, software that is delivered on time, within budget, and that satisfies its requirements"
  - a quantifiable approach
  
### Forces that Impact Software
1. Quality
2. Cost
3. Schedule

### BASIC steps in building software
Waterfall Model: ![waterfall](http://whatsupnew.com/wp-content/uploads/waterfall-model.png)
- 2/3 of Effort/Cost is Spent in Maintenance
  - Only 1/3 is in initial development
- As the project progresses, the cost to make a change increases dramatically
